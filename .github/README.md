# TIE Fighter Pilot Editor
The X-Wing Pilot Editor is a utility that will allow you to edit pilot files for the LucasArts game "TIE Fighter '98".
## Use
- To change an existing pilot file, load it using the File Open icon on the tool bar.  
- Just like the game, your pilot's name is taken from the file name.  If you want to change the name, save the file with a different file name.  
- To create a new pilot file, use the File New icon on the tool bar.  Saving a file using the icon on the tool bar will prompt you for a file name.  If you choose the same name, you will overwrite your existing pilot file.  There is no automatic backup feature.
- Changeable data values have names that closely resemble the corresponding name in the game.
## Notes
- This program will only edit pilot files compatible with TIE Fighter '98.  It will not automatically convert different formats.
- This program is not fully compatible with custom missions or modifications to TIE Fighter '98.
